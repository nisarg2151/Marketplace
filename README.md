## Problem Statement
BT/Openreach engages with various corporate Civil Suppliers for any Civil Work required during the provisioning journey or strategic expansion into newer areas. These suppliers in turn sub contracts various small to medium level suppliers for completing the work for which OR has to pay a premium to their corporate supplier. So if there can be a central marketplace platform which can felicitate the engagement directly between Businesses and Suppliers that can help both the parties do business more openly and fluently.  The same platform should be generic & expandable to accommodate other 3rd party engagements as well as be open to businesses other then BT/Openreach.
